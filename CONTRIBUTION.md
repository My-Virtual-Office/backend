```

**Example:**
- `[#14631]: Updated escaping to non-escaping in JavadocTokenTypes.java`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Comment on the issue** with "I am on it"
2. **Create a properly named branch**
3. **Ensure tests pass locally** (`mvn clean verify`)
4. **Submit PR following the template**
5. **Reference the issue** in the PR description
8. **Respond to all reviewer comments**
9. **Rebase on latest master** when updating (Run **`git rebase main`** before pushing changes)

### How to Rebase Your Branch
If you are new to open-source contributions, follow these steps to properly rebase your branch:

1. Ensure you are on your feature branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout <your-branch>
   ```
2. Fetch the latest changes from the main branch:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   ```
3. Rebase your branch on top of the latest main branch:
   ```sh
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
4. If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase:
   ```sh
   git add <resolved-files>
   git rebase --continue
   ```
5. Push your changes forcefully to update the PR:
   ```sh
   git push origin <your-branch> --force
   ```

## How to Amend a Commit
If you need to modify the latest commit (e.g., fix a typo or add missing changes), you can use `git commit --amend`:

1. Make the necessary changes in your files.
2. Add the changes to the staging area:
   ```sh
   git add <modified-files>
   ```
3. Amend the last commit:
   ```sh
   git commit --amend
   ```
   This will open your default text editor, allowing you to modify the commit message if needed.
4. Push the amended commit forcefully:
   ```sh
   git push origin <your-branch> --force
   ```
